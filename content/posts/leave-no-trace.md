When you're out hiking in the woods (or anywhere, actually) the
concept of [Leave no
trace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leave_No_Trace) means exactly
what it sounds like. Leave no trace. Leave no garbage, litter,
detritus, or crap of your own behind to spoil the environment and mar
the experience of the next person who comes along.

Better still -- if someone else leaves their crap behind, pack that
out too, if you can.
