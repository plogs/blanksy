[Leave the gate as you found it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leave_the_gate_as_you_found_it)
(or leave all gates as found) is an
important rule of courtesy in rural areas throughout the world. If a
gate is found open, it should be left open, and if it is closed, it
should be left closed. If a closed gate absolutely must be traversed,
it should be closed again afterwards. It applies to visitors
travelling onto or across farms, ranches, and stations.
