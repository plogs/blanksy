I don't like bully behaviour, even when it's ostensibly for a `good cause'.

The problem (as always) with `good cause' is that your good cause may not
be the same as my good cause.

One person's artistic political expression is another person's propaganda.

Paint on _your_ wall if you want. Looks great!

Leave mine alone.

Thanks,
