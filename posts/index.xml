      <description>When you&amp;rsquo;re out hiking in the woods (or anywhere, actually) the concept of Leave no trace means exactly what it sounds like. Leave no trace. Leave no garbage, litter, detritus, or crap of your own behind to spoil the environment and mar the experience of the next person who comes along.
Better still &amp;ndash; if someone else leaves their crap behind, pack that out too, if you can.</description>

      <description>Leave the gate as you found it (or leave all gates as found) is an important rule of courtesy in rural areas throughout the world. If a gate is found open, it should be left open, and if it is closed, it should be left closed. If a closed gate absolutely must be traversed, it should be closed again afterwards. It applies to visitors travelling onto or across farms, ranches, and stations.</description>

      <description>To cause (someone) to do something by means of force or coercion.
In the case of graffiti, one forces others to, &amp;ldquo;Look at me! Look at me!&amp;rdquo;</description>
